      <h2>Major Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Final Year Project</h3>
          <li>Investigated the efficacy of using Aerogel as an insulator for Superconductors during magnetic levitation and designed a primitive cryostat. </li>
          <li>Comapring theory to simulated data and then to experimental data.</li>
          <li>Main work was on the magnetostatic and thermal simulations of the superconductor and the sourcing of the rare equipment</li>
          <li>The given budget was £75. I had to negotiate with Cambridge University for the superconductors, various companies to get the aerogel and large enough magents.</li>
          <li>Wrote a report and several other assignments that was awarded 71%, a First class</li>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>(Robotic Autonomous Zimmerframe) RAZ robot</h3>
          <li>Started off as a design competition and led onto a £6000 budgeted project by the Uni that I led</li>
          <li>designed and delivered a proposal with a team to the judges for a robot to help elderely</li>
          <li>Led the project as a whole with extemely limited input from the University staff</li>
          <li>Duties included: Project management/general oversight, led concept design, led mechanical system design, budgetting and purchasing and recruitment including product designer competition</li>
          <li>Subprojects handled: Lifting mechanism design, arm pressure matrix design usign velostat, Planar movement mechanism for the robot, </li>
